# pytorch-notebooks
These are pytorch notebooks, Implementation of  GAN (generative adversarial network )  using  deep neural networks, generating MNIST digits and human faces using GAN.
  * 1st notebook file contains tensor-operations
  * 2nd notebook file Insurance cost prediction using linear regression. 
  * 3rd notebook file is Classifying images of everyday objects using a neural network (CNN). 
  * Myproject.ipynb contains generation of human faces using GAN.   
  * gan_training.avi is video demonstrating how human faces generated from GAN.
